# Website Enhancements to Showcase HireEdge's Resume Engine

## Current Strengths to Highlight
- **Rich CV parsing and validation.** The API already extracts contact info, multiple résumé sections, and enforces upload limits with graceful 400 responses when text is missing or invalid, which proves the product understands candidate data deeply.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L415-L654】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1218-L1390】
- **Insight and impact generation.** Automatic keyword insights, outreach kits, and impact highlights are produced with AI/fallback metadata so every candidate receives actionable differentiators.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L302-L358】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L892-L1092】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1404-L1515】
- **Flexible delivery formats.** Responses can be JSON or DOCX with optional document attachments, plus exposed timing headers for transparency.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1238-L1399】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1518-L1795】

## Recommended Website Updates
1. **Insight dashboard on the landing experience.** Surface the matched/missing keyword lists and narrative summary in a hero widget or interactive cards so users instantly see how HireEdge diagnoses their fit for a job. This builds trust in the “Role-Ready Insights” section before they download anything.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L302-L358】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1518-L1712】
2. **Outreach kit call-to-action panel.** Dedicate a section that previews the elevator pitch, email subject line, and LinkedIn note with one-click copy buttons. Pair it with testimonials explaining how candidates used the kit to contact hiring managers, underscoring the unique outreach differentiator.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L892-L999】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1660-L1712】
3. **Impact highlight spotlight.** Add a carousel or timeline that showcases the quantified achievements generated by the API, encouraging users to feed in metrics and emphasising measurable results in the résumé output.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L990-L1092】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1638-L1660】
4. **Format selector and performance transparency.** Provide toggles that mirror the API’s JSON/DOCX and `includeDocument` preferences, and display the per-section timing metadata in a “How this was crafted” modal so prospects appreciate the system’s speed and reliability.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1238-L1399】【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1518-L1795】
5. **Guided onboarding for uploads vs. pasted text.** Since the backend distinguishes between uploaded files and pasted CVs, build a guided stepper that explains the benefits of each option and surfaces validation tips (supported formats, size limits, text extraction) to reduce failed submissions.【F:pages/api/generate-resume.js†L1218-L1390】

Implementing these website enhancements will better communicate HireEdge’s differentiators, making the experience feel proactive and insight-led compared to traditional résumé builders. The complete marketing experience now lives at the root route (`/`) and is also mirrored at `/marketing` for easy sharing and previewing during staging rollouts.
